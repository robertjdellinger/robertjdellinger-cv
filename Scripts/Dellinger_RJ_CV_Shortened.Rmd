# Educational Experience

## **Ph.D. Student, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences**  
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) | 2024 – Present  
Advisors: Dr. Aradhna Tripati & Dr. Robert Eagle  

_Research focus:_ Coral biomineralization and symbiont community dynamics under climate variability and coastal land-use change, integrating multi-proxy geochemistry with ancient DNA (coraDNA).  

## **M.S., Biological Sciences**  
California State University, Northridge (CSUN) | 2021 – 2024  
Advisor: Dr. Nyssa Silbiger  

_Research focus:_ Quantitative marine ecology and biogeochemistry, examining the physiological and energetic responses of marine invertebrates to the combined impacts of ocean acidification and warming.  

## **B.S., Marine & Coastal Science, and B.A., International Relations**  
University of California, Davis | 2017 – 2021  
*Departmental Citation for Outstanding Achievement and Contributions*  

Study Abroad Program: "Ecological and Social Issues in Lake Atitlán, Guatemala"

# Fellowships & Awards *(Selected)*

UCLA Eugene V. Cota Robles Fellowship (2024–2029)  
National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2021–2026)  
Center for Diverse Leadership in Science Fellowship (2022–2025)  
National Science Foundation Science-Policy NRT Award (2022) 

# Research & Professional Experience *(Selected)*

## **Graduate Research Assistant, Critical Ecology Lab (2024–2025)**  
- Analyzed how social drivers (e.g., structural racism, classism, and unequal resource distribution) shape the geography of industrial emissions, and how these inequality-driven pollutants contribute to acid rain formation and long-term shifts in forest ecosystem function at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (NSF LTER), linking inequality to environmental change through a critical ecology framework.  

## **Graduate Student Researcher, Cal State Northridge (2021–2024)**  
- Designed and executed mesocosm experiments testing how ocean acidification and warming affect the physiological energetics of intertidal species, maintaining precise carbonate chemistry and temperature treatments, and later applied advanced statistical modeling to quantify thermal performance curves and metabolic responses. 

## **Research Intern, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2021)**  
- Conducted histopathological analyses to evaluate contaminant impacts on estuarine fish in urban ecosystems, examining multiple tissues for markers of stress, disease, and injury; contributed to a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) by quantifying pollutant-induced physiological changes, and presented findings to scientists and policymakers at NOAA’s Student Symposium.
